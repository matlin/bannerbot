# Bannerbot
### An automated class registration tool for Middlebury Bannerweb built on Python Mechanize.   
**DISCLAMER: Use at your own risk. I am not responsible for any problems or bugs that may go wrong during operation.**   
Currently you can run the script as is, in a python console. Answer the prompts and the script should automate everything else.   
Installers and GUI coming soon...
